# Project Overview

London Bike Sharing is a project that explores different aspects of the use of bicycles as a mode of urban transportation in the city of London. Through the chosen dataset, we analyzed usage patterns, bike models, routes, and, subsequently, the stations with the highest flow of rides. Here, you will find all the links related to the project—from the dataset itself, through the data cleaning and preprocessing steps, to the final dashboard and presentation with our conclusions. The project also leaves room for further exploration of other aspects and factors based on the findings so far—these next steps will be added here soon.

# Bike Sharing Context

Over the past years, bicycle-sharing systems have grown in both number and popularity across cities worldwide. These systems allow users to rent bicycles on a short-term basis for a fee—meaning they can borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, or to the same location if they just want to go for a ride. Since this is a shared system and can be used as a form of public transportation, each bike can serve several users per day. Because the entire rental process is usually managed through apps, it also makes it easy to collect and analyze data on usage. In this study, data provided by Transport for London (TfL) was particularly helpful, as it allowed us to cross-check various information and validate the analyses and conclusions we reached.
