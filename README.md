# Project Overview

London Bike Sharing explores different aspects of bicycle use as a mode of urban transportation in London. Using the dataset, we analyzed:
* Usage patterns and trends
* Bike models and their popularity
* Most traveled routes
* Stations with the highest flow of rides
This repository contains all resources related to the project, including the dataset, data cleaning and preprocessing steps, and the final dashboard and presentation.
Future updates will explore additional factors and analyses based on the findings so far.

# Bike Sharing Context

Bicycle-sharing systems have grown rapidly in both number and popularity across cities worldwide. These systems allow users to rent bicycles on a short-term basis, enabling them to pick up a bike at one location and return it at another, or back to the same location for leisure rides.
Key points about bike-sharing systems:
* Each bike can serve multiple users per day.
* Rental processes are usually managed via apps, making data collection straightforward.
* Analysis of these datasets can reveal patterns useful for urban planning, station placement, and service improvement.
For this study, we used data provided by Transport for London (TfL) to validate analyses and insights.


# Data Sources and Tools

We used a Kaggle dataset containing all ride data in London for August 2023.
Tools used:
* Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Google Colab (Python, pandas)
* Visualization & Dashboard: Power BI
* Dataset: London Bike Sharing Dataset on Kaggle
The data was cleaned, organized, and transformed as necessary to enable analysis and hypothesis development. A Power BI dashboard was created to make the insights easily accessible, visually appealing, and easy to understand—even for first-time viewers.

# Key Findings
Some of the main insights from the analysis include:
* Peak usage times during weekdays and weekends
* Most popular routes and stations
* Patterns in bike model preferences
* Opportunities for improving station allocation and service efficiency
(These findings can be further explored in the final dashboard and presentation.)

# Next Steps
Potential future directions for this project include:
* Analyzing seasonal or monthly trends in bike usage
* Studying user demographics and behavior patterns
* Exploring route optimization and bike redistribution strategies
* Incorporating external factors, such as weather or events, into the analysis
